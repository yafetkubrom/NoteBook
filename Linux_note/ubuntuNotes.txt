What is a linux
	- Your computer, despite being a collection of highly sophisticated parts, is really just...well, 
	a collection of highly sophisticated parts. On its own, it can do nothing other than switch on and off and spin a disk. 
	In order for it to do something meaningful, it needs an operating system (OS). Mac, DOS and window are example of such. 
	Linux is yet another. But it differes in that it was not created by a corporation or someone to make money but by Linus Torvalds who created a 
	system like Unix that would work on home computers and decided to share it openly. 

- Although you can use Linux by itself by typing commands on black screen, it has GUI throught the graphical desktop environment or GNOME. 
- what is a distribution
	- An operating system consists of a lot of files that perform a lof of different functions. 
	Since there is no Linux corporation to pachage and distribute the files, variety of groups of entities create Linux system and application 
	collections called Distributions (Distros). All distros basically consist the core OS(Linux Kernel), 
	some sort of installer program to get all Parts and Applications, the X Window System for graphical interface support, 
	one or more grapical desktop envirnment and series of applications such as audio players and word processors to make things work. 

Terminal	
	- ykubrom@ubuntu:~$
	- ykubrom is the username
	- ubuntu is name you give your computer
	- ~ (tilde) signifies that I am in my home folder. 
Bash (Shell)

	- Bash(Bourne Again Shell) is one of the many shells that are used in linux systems and it is the one that comes with ubuntu distro. 
	- Shell is a program that interprets the commands you type into the Terminal and delivers them to your system. 
	Think about it as a commands handling subsystem for which Terminal is its graphical front end. 
	Some scripting languages have their own shells. (you have scripting language and shell is what interprets it. )

firewall
	- The first line of defence for any computer hooked to internet is a router, an electronic device that allows a number of computers on a local network to connect and share a single connection from your internet service provider(ISP). Most routers include a firewall.
	- Firewall stops from bad stuff on the web. 
	- To edit the firewall on your router, type the IP address of the router. 
	- If not, firestarter is a popular software available for firewalls.
