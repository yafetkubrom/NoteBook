Boot
	- In computing, booting is the process of starting a computer.
	- It can be initiated by hardware such as a button press, or by a software command.
	- After it is switched on, a computer's central processing unit has no software in 
		its main memory, so some process must load software into memory before it can
		execute.
	- boot is short for bootstrap as in "to pull oneself up by one's bootstrap"
		- meaning a smaller simpler program loads and execute the larger complicated ones.
	
- Linux startup process is multi-staged initialization process performed during booting a Linux installation.
	- examples of the stages are boot loader phase(ex. grub), kernel phase, init

- simplified startup
	1 - System powers up. Bios does minimal hardware initialization then hand control to boot loader
	2 - Boot loader calls the kernel
	3 - Kernel loads Ram disk that load system drives then look fo root file system
	4 - Once kernel is set up, it begins the systemd initialization system
	5 - systemd takes control and continues to mount the host's file systems and start service. 
- Another simplified
	kernel -> systemd -> getty -> login -> bash
	- systemd - invoked at end of startup procedure
			- responsible for starting up and shutting down the sys.
	- getty - created by init process, manage terminal type (tty)
	- login - process that authenticated the user. shell is created. 

Installation
	Options:

	cent OS 
		installing desktop
			yum -y groups install "GNOME Desktop"
			startx
			systemctl set-default graphical.target
Users
	- <definition>
	- commands
		list of Users					less /etc/passwd
		list of groups					less /etc/group
		groups a user belongs to 		groups <username>
		members belonging to group		getent group <username>	
		sudo usermod -a -G sudo <username>	// if no sudo, use wheel

	Partition:
	  - /dev/sda1 ntfs should be windows 
	  	- Windows10 should be partitioned by itself(/dev/sda1 or 2
	  - use the free space for ubuntu
		- shrink windows but live space since window have big files
	- swap
	  - Primary vs Logical partition
		- Primary Partition holds OS files and you can boot from it. 
			- max 4 primary can be created
		- Logical partition holds files/images/videos. 
	  - File Systems (fat32, ext4, swap,)???

bootable
	- Grup is booting manager for Ubuntu.
		- ???

commands
	Open file 
		- xdg-open filename (from linux)
		- open filename (from mac)

	ls	ls -l 	-long list with permission statues
		ls -r 	-list in reverse order
		ls -s 	-list with size info
		l     	-list
		ls --help 

	!!      Do the previous command

	error with permission
		- sudo nano filename
		or 
		- sudo su 
		- do your thang
		 - sudo yafet (when done)

	using apt-get
		- sudo apt-get install xxxx
		- sudo apt-get remove xxxx
		- to install program that you dont know name
	   		- apt-cache search bluefish*
		- to see if you have it installed
	  	 	- apt-cache policy bluefish
		- if you download deb file from browser
	   		- sudo dpkg -i ./filename.deb

permission	- ls -l
		- drwxr-xr-x (you-group-public)
			- example : create file thru nano then check its permission.
					if you wanna change it:
					- sudo chown user:group filename (chang ownership) 
					- user - who owns it. group - to share with
					- sudo chmod 664 filename(6 rw and 4 is r)
			- if you sudo mkdir, it belongs to root. if mkdir, it belong to u. 
		- to chown directory, same. chown -R if u want chown every file in the dir
				-R for recursive
creating file
		- rm dir/*   	// to remove all content inside dir but leave dir.
		- rm -rf	// delete dir even if not empty. use rmdir if empty.
 		- cp file /location/name	// copy file into the location and give name. 
		- mv filename newfilename	// move does not leave copy.


Find	- find . -type f -name "name" 	// . is current dir. or /dir for another dir
					// -type is by type, -size look by size							// name = *.php or name of file, iname = ignor cap
					// f = file , d = directory
	- find . -type f -perm 0644	// permission
	- find . -size -1M 		// size under 1M byte
	- find . -type f -not -iname "name"
	- find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname "*.conf"  // look only 1 layer of folder. 
	- find . -type f -size -10k -iname "*.php" // both types


Find (within a file
	- grep "using" hello.cpp	 
	- grep -i "using" hello.cpp	//ignore case
	- grep -n "using" hello.cpp	// line number where it occur
	- find .... -exec grep ... {} +


redirect output to file
	- ls > outfile.txt
	- ls | tee outfile.txt // brint in screen and to file

c++
	- sudo apt-get install g++    (compiler)
	- sudo apt-get install geany (editor)
	- compile - build - run
	- compile - g++ -c code.cpp and it produces file named code.o
	- build - g++ -o code code.cpp and it produces file named code 
	- run - ./code
