Serverless Computing
    - Serverless (application) are ones that don't require you to provision or manage any servers.
    - Serverless Application w/ AWS
        Compute - Lambda
        API - API Gateway
		- https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/resources/
        Storage - S3
        Database - DynamoDB
        Interprocess Messageing - SQS
        Orchestration - CloudWatch
        Analytics - Kinesis


AWS Lambda
    - computer layer of your serverless application where your code is executed.
    - deploy functions. triggered by events. also known as FaaS. lambda is serverless FaaS.
    - FaaS is one approach to building event-driven computing systems. 
    - Serverless FaaS is one appraoch to FaaS. 

    - single lambda functions
        code - what gets executed
        configuration - how the code is executed
        event sources - detect event and invoke function (API Gateway for HTTPS request, SNS for topic when posted)
            - lambda also has RESTful API to run directly by calling the API without need for outside event sources.


    * lambda functions are triggered based on event. They scale based on size of workload. therefore they dont incur charge
    or computer power when not being used. 

AWS Lambda (Coding)
    Clean up
        - delete function
        - delete log group 
        - delete execution role
