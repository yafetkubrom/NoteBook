IAM (Identity and Access Management)
    * Create and manage entities access permissions.
    * Centralized * Access * Permission * Identity Federation
    * features
        * multi*factor Authentiction
        * temporary access 
        * password policy (rotation)
        * Integrated 
        * Complience (PCI DSS)
    * Objects
        * Users * groups * roles * (policy - doc that define perm. for U, G, R)
        * AWS access policy is written in JSON
    * Testing 
        * https://policysim.aws.amazon.com

    **ToDo**    * Implement RSA SecurID using SSO SAML agent
                * Understand roles 

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
    * Benefits
        * Secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
        * Like VM but hosted in AWS 
        * Makes web-based cloud computing easier && gives you full control.
        * Solved the problem of on-prem infrastructure.
    * Pricing
        * On Demand 
            * Flexible * Short term * Testing the water
        * Reserved 
            * Predictable usage * Pay Up-Front * 72% off on-demand * choose time frame
        * Spot 
            * Flexible (only) * Cost-Senstive (only) * Urgent Capacity * 90% discount
        * Dedicated 
            * Specific needs (Complience or Licensing restriction) * on-demand or reserved
        ** Saving Plans && Price Calculator
    * Types
        ** Hardware (cpu, memory, storage)
        ** Capabilities (grouped into families)
    * EBS
        ** gp2 - general purpose (ssd) > 16000 IOPS 
            *** gp3 (latest) > 20% cheaper
        ** io1 - provisioned (ssd) > 64000 IOPS
            *** io2 (latest) > same price as io1 but higher durability & higher iops per gib.
        ** io2 block express (ssd) > 256000 IOPS and durability
            data intenstive apps like oracle
        ** st1 (hhd) > upto 500 MB/s per volume
            *** for mountains of data , frequently accessed (ex. big data)
            *** cant be boot volume 
        ** sc1 (hdd) > cheapest, upto 250 MB/s per volume.
            *** performace not factory and scan few per day. 
        ** IOPS vs Throughput
            *** IOPS measure number of r/w operation per second
            *** Throughput measure number of bits r/w per second
            *** IOPS for quick tranaction while Throughput for big data 
        ** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html
    * Elastic LB
        ** Application Load Balancer 
        ** Network Load Balancer
        ** Gateway Load Balancer 
        ** Classic Load Balancer (legacy)
            *** HTTP/HTTPs & web server is best handled by ALB
            *** High performamce load balancing by NLB
            *** legacy option. http & tcp by CLB
            *** for 3rd-party virtual applicances handled by GLB
            *** X-Forwarded-For - header option for IPv4 address of end user coming thru LB.
    * Roles 
        ** Roles is the preferred option to allow ec2 access to other services.
            *** policies control a role's permissions.
    * AWS CLI 
        ** S3 > https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/
    * Route 53
        ** Amazon's DNS service.
    * RDS 
        ** Relational Database (sql server, mysql, mariadb, oracle, postgres, aurora)
        ** Good for OLTP
        ** OLTP = process data from tranaction in real-time. 
        ** OLAP = process complex queries to analyze histrocial data.
        ** Multi-AZ = copy of your DB in another AZ. (on Standby. automatically switch if origional is down)
        ** read-replica = read-only copy of your primary DB. 
        ** Two ways to backup: DB Snapshot (manual) & Automated backup. 
    * ElastiCache 
        ** Store frequently quered data in memory.
        ** two types. memcached & redis. 
        ** Typical scenerio. read-heavy DB & data not changed frequently.
        ** Multi-AZ
            *** is for DR(Disaster Recovery), not improving performace. Cant connect to standby when primary DB is active.
            *** to improve performance, increase read replica. Read Replica is read-only copy of primary DB.
        ** Multi-AZ
            *** is for DR(Disaster Recovery), not improving performace. Cant connect to standby when primary DB is active.
            *** to improve performance, increase read replica. Read Replica is read-only copy of primary DB.

Exam Tips
    IAM policy sim
        * Test IAM permissions before you commit them to prod
        * validate policy works
        * great for troubleshooting. 
    IAM
        * IAM is universal not regional.
        * New users have no permission when created.
        * access keys and secret access keys given when user is created.
            used for loggin in programmatically, not console. 
        * roles give aws service access to act on your behalf. 
    EBS 
        * gp2 and gp3 for < 16000 IOPS
        * io1 and io2 for > 16000 IOPS (io2 more iops per gib)
        * io2 block express > 256000
        ** HDD 
        * st1 amd sc1 (cheapest and lowest performance)
