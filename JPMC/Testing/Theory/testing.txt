Software Testing 
    the proces of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do.

    2 testing practises:
        Manual - done by person, interacting with software or API with some tool
        Automatic - done by machine, executes a test script written in advance.
        * Automatic testing is integral part CI/CD. (check out DevOps testing tutorials)
    
    3 major types of testing
        Unit Tests - low level, test individual methods, and functions of a class.
        Integration Tests - verify that different modules or services work well together. ex. b/n microservices.
        Functional Tests - focus on business requirements of an application. focus on output.
    Other types    
        End-to-end Tests - replicates user behavior with the software. verify various user flows work as expected.
        Acceptance Testing - verify if a system satisfies its business requirments. requires for entire app to be up.
        Performance Testing - check behavior of the system when it is under significant load.
        Smoke Testing - basic tests that check basic functionality of the app. useful right after new build. 

Automating Testing
    To automate testing, you need to write them programmatically using testing framework.
