Algorithms 
    - process or set of rules required to perform calculation or problem-solving operation.
    - carried in specific order to perform the task.
    - Not the whole program, just the logic
    - could be described using flowchart or pseudocode.
    - characters
        - input, output, unambiguity, language independent
    - parts
        - Theorical - must know theorical aspect of the problem
        - Practical - must be able to implement it into practical.
    - Approaches 
        - Brute Force Algorithms
        - Divide and Conquer
        - Greedy Method
        - Dynamic Programming
        - Branch and Bound 
        - Randomized
        - Backtracking
    - catogories
        - sort, search, delete, insert, update
    - Complexity
        - Time Complexity
    - Types
        - Search Algorithms (Linear and Binary)
        - Sort Algorithms
