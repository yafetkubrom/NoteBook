Book - Spring In Action

Part 1 Chapter 1 - Getting Started with Spring

Key Terms - 
	- Reactive Programming - 
		- Reactive programming creates software that responds to events rather than solicits inputs from users.  
		- An event is simply a signal that something has happened.
		- they must be processed in real time. 
	- Beans
	- autowiring (page 28)
		- Spring automatically inject the components along with the other beans it depend on. 
	- component scanning
		- Spring will discover component from apps classpath and add them as beans. 
	- autoconfiguration 
		- Spring Boot can make reasonable guesses of what components need to be configured and wired together, 
		- based on entries in the classpath, environment variables, and other factors 
	- render - process that turns website code into interactive page. 
	- parse - analyzing and converting a program into internal format a runtime env could actually run.


Definitions - 
	- Application is a container with many components.  
	- Spring application context 
		- Spring offers a container that create and manage application components. 
	- Beans - this components are called beans. 
	- This beans are wired together inside the spring application context like bricks make a house. 
	- Dependency Injection - act of wiring together beans. 
		- instead of components create and manage other beans it depends on, 
			it lets the container create and manage them and inject them as needed.  
	- WAR was traditionally used for applications and JAR for libraries but with cloud, JAR is better approach for application too.
	- Explanation of what is provided by spring initializer (1.2.2)

	- @controller, @service, @repository identifies the class as component for component scanning. When discovered, it becomes a bean 
		in the spring application context

Technologies
	- Thymeleaf is a template engine for HTML 
		- It caches template pages when they are parsed so that they won't be parsed again.
		- the disadvantage is that when developer changes a template, the program will still run the one in cache. 
		- LiveReload is part of DevTools that if your browser supports it, could reload when changes are made.  
	- devTools enables developer to change HTML or Java code while application is running and the app will automatically refresh. 
		- with devTools enabled, Spring loads the app into two parts. Code that could change (src/main) and code that won't (dependencies, JVM)
		- Therefore change to dependency won't be recognized. Must do hard reset.
		- If H2 (in-memory DB) is enabled, devtools have an interface to display the tables.
			- http://localhost:8080/h2-console  
	- Core Spring Framework
		- core container and dependency injection framework
	- Spring Boot
		- Starter dependency and autoconfiguration
		- Actuator provides runtime insight into inner workings of running application
	- Spring Data
		- Allow you to define your application's repositories as java interfaces and work with different databases. 
	- Spring Security
		- authentication, authorization, API security. 
	- Spring Cloud
		- Microservices
