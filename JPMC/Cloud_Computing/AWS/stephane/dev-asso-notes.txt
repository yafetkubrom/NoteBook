AWS Developer Associate

AWS History
	2002 internally launched
	2004 SQS
	2005 EC2, S3
	2007 Europe

AWS Regions - cluster of data centers. Ex. us-east-1
	How to choose Region. Complience, Proximity, Service Availability, Price
AWS AZ - one or more discrete data centers, connected w/ high bandwidth. ex. us-east-1a, us-east-1b.
AWS Data Centers -
AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence - presence of aws in countries


IAM
	Overview 
		Identity & Access Management
		Global Service
		Users & Groups
	IAM Policies
		set of permission in JSON docs
	IAM MFA
		Multi Factor Authentiction
		MFA = password you know + device you own
		MFA devices 	- Virtual MFA devices, 
				- Universal 2nd factor (hardware)
				- hardware key fob MFA (regular and gov version)

	IAM AWS Access Keys
		3 ways to access AWS services
			1. AWS management console (protected by password & MFA)
			2. AWS CLI (protected by access keys)
			3. AWS SDK (protected by access keys)
		AWS Access keys generated thru console
		Access key ID ~= username
		Secret Access Key ~= password
		* AWS CLI - direct access to public APIs of AWS services
		* AWS SDK - Language Specific - embedded into your application
		* ex. AWS CLI is created using python AWS SDK

	AWS CloudShell
		alternative to CLI. CLI on aws site
		doesnt need to be configured
		by default, uses the region you logged in to. 
		data saved are persistance
	IAM Roles for Services
		Some services will need to perform task on your behalf
		IAM Roles - access management for services
	IAM Security Tools
		IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
		IAM Access Advisor (User-level)

EC2 Foundamentals
	Overview
		Elastic Compute Cloud
		Elastic - easily created, launched, deleted, or scaled.
		IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
	Budget Setup
		view bill
		set up budge 
	EC2 Basics
		allows you to rent VMs, store data (EBS), ELB, ASG
		config: OS, CPU, RAM, EBS (storage), Network Card, 
			Firewall (security groups), Bootstrap Script (EC2 User Data)
		config: AMI, 
	EC2 Types
		https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types
		For Exam, know the types and benefits
		m5.2xlarge	// m = instance class, 5 = generation, 2xlarge = size within class
		instances.vantage.sh	// overview of all sizes
	Security Groups
		Could attach to multiple instances
		attached to regions/VPC combination
		lives outside the EC2
		maintain one separate security group for ssh (developer to developer tips)
		ELB : instance with security group 1 could communicate with 
			another instance which references that security group.
		classical ports, 22, 21, 22(sftp), 80, 443
	SSH
		ssh, putty, ec2 instance connect (browser, only linux 2)
			* instance connect still use ssh
		ssh -i .pem ec2-user@ip	// first chmod 0400 .pem
	EC2 - IAM Roles
		- Do not ever enter IAM info into ec2. instead attach a role to ec2 to access IAM. 
	On Exam
		Ec2 instance launch types. which option is best for this <task> based on the launch options.
		options. on-demand, Reserved, Spot instance (bid), & dedicated hosts

	EC2 components
		EBS - Elastic Block Store
			- network drive
			- could persist even after instance's termination
			- bound to AZ
			- 1 EBS per one instance (CCP level) 
			- By Default, root EBS is set "delete on termination" but other EBS are not.
			- attach an instance > https://devopscube.com/mount-ebs-volume-ec2-instance/
			- EBS Snapshot (Backup)
		EBS types
			- differ in size, throughput, IOPS
		AMI - Amazon Machine Image
			- customization of EC2 instance (software, config, OS, monitoring)
			- Launch instance from public AMI, your own AMI, AWS Marketplace AMI (made by others)
		EC2 Instance Store
			- volume is attached to ec2 hardware.
			- faster IOPS 
			- Not reliable. could be lost.
			- ex. for cache 
		EFS
			- Elastic File system
			- could be attached to multiple instances and change to content is reflected across all.
			- more expensive.
			- pay by use. dont have to provision size ahead of time. 
			- efs mount helper > sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
	ELB & ASG
		- Intro
			- Vertical vs Horzontil scaling
			- High Availability
		- ELB
			- Elastic Load Balancer
			- Health Check
			- 4 types: CLB, ALB, NLB, GLB(latest)
				- ALB - specify target group 
				- NLB - static IP (instead of hostname)

CLI Commands
	aws configure
	aws iam list-users 

Exxtra
	EC2
		EC2's base operating system is believed to be based on customized version of 
			Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).
		On top of that, for the Virtual Machine, AWS uses Xen Hypervisor.
