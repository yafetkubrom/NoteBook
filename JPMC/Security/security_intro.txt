Spring Cloud 
    - Spring Cloud Config gives you the ability to encrypt sensitive properties. 
    - Spring Cloud Config supports both symmetric (shared secret) and asymmetric (private/public key) encryption.
        - asymmetric encryption is more secure. becuase it used more modern and more complex algorithms.
        - symmetric is more convienent because we only need to define a single property.
