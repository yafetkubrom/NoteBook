Raspberry pi 
	- series of small single-board computers
	- developed in UK by Raspbeery Pi F & Broadcom.

Raspberry pi 4 (mine)
	OS - Ubuntu Server
	SoaC - Broudcom BCM2411B0
	CPU - 1.5 GHz quad-core A72 64-bit
	memory - 2 (2, 4, 8) SDRAM
	gpu - Broadcom VideoCore 500 MHz

Ubuntu
	Install from https://ubuntu.com/raspberry-pi
	disksutil list
	dd if=<input> of=<output> bs=4M		// output=/dev/disk4
	
	troubleshoot
	- diskutil
		- df -h
		- diskutil unmount disk/diskns1
		- df -h		// to make sure it is unmounted


1 - install heatsink 
	- it keeps temperature down on cpu, memory and 

2 - connect all components
3 - micro sd come with noobs so I installed raspbian full. 

Project ideas:
 Use pi as server and write server-client code
 pi hole
 Write to pi from linux via ssh

Apache
	- Apache is a popular web server application you can install on the Raspberry Pi to allow it to serve web pages.
	- On its own, Apache can serve HTML files over HTTP. With additional modules it can serve dynamic web pages using scripting languages such as PHP.
