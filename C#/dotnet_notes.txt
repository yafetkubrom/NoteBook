- Controller should be different for all resources. Don't have one controller for whole project.

- Entity Framework
	- microsoft.entityframeworkcore
	- microsoft.entityframeworkcore.design
	- microsoft.entityframeworkcore.sqlserver (for other DB, change the name )
		- for mysql, they have entity support. get link from nuget.org
- encrypt connection string to hide password (kinda difficult to do)
- When migrating to mysql database, i received error with Create method. 
	the reason was that mysql entity framework support works with older version of ef
	Instead, use an alternative support found on nuget.
	- NEW UPDATE the alternative support was Pomelo but must download the latest version.
