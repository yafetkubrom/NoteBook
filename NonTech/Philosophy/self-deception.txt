Self-Deception
Is there value to self-deception? I think not. That would be my first thought. It is never good to lie and therefore, not a good idea to lie to yourself. Now, I can see why some would say there is value in self-deception. After all, we do lie to ourself in order to keep ourselves sane. Those decisions are usually made unconsciously so we prolly can't change that. But are they the best decisions. I guess the obvious answer would be no. But why do we prefer to lie to ourselves if we know there are better coping strategies that doesn't involve self-deception. I guess a precursor to that question would be are we aware that there are better coping strategies in the "bucket" of coping strategies? After long thought, I would say I am aware that there are realistic ways of coping but their outcome are not guaranteed. Secondly, I am inexperienced with using them so I go after the default. I wouldn't even say default but the one that promises better result. Now I do always wish I can be comfortable with the realistic ones tho. 
SO Julia have given me some things to consider when facing a negative emotion. 1 make a plan.
Example. I feel bad about being single right now and in order to protect my mood, I say well, I was in school so I didn't have time and the pandemic made it hard to meet people. The actual reason is that I did not have the skills and the confidence to ask a girl out. 
1. Make a plan
	- I can go to places where I could meet girls
	- I can watch tutorials 
	- I can practice lines at home
	- I could try online dating
2. Notice silver lining
	- not dating did prolly help you stay focused in school
	- You could have rushed into a relationship and be unhappy now
	- You could have breaking up and be dealing with hurt now
3. Focus on different goal
	- Instead of saying I want to date, say I want to find a girl who like reading
	- I want to friend a girl who I don't already know
4. Things could be worse
	- I could be too old to think about girls.
	- I could be in a position where girls don't want to be with me
Of course, this is not a complete list but this will help someone cope with an event that brings negative emotions. You can protect yourself with creating a coping strategies that deal with the actually problem instead of self-deception to achieve its goal.
