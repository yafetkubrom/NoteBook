In Node Js function, req.body handles strings. For files (ex. images), you have to choices.
    - send it raw as binary (con : wont know where it came from unless you somehow attach extra data)
    - Send along with other data (form data) (preferred)

To send along with other data, use library. I use multer

multer
    nodejs middleware for handling "multipart/form-data" which is primarily used for uploading files.
    only hanldes multipart form 
    npm install --save multer

    set size limit
    const upload = multer({storage: storage, limits: {
        fileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 
    }});

    filter 
    const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
        if (file.mimetype === 'image/jpeg' || file.mimetype === 'image/png') {
            cb(null, true);
        } else {
            cb(null, false);
        }
    };

    Storing files into folders makes the file harder to retrieve. two ways to solve.
        make the folder available to public
            app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));
        programmically configure the get request to look inside that folder name
